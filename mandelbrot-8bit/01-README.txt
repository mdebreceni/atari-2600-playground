This is a version of the Mandelbrot generator that uses 8-bit fixed point numbers
These numbers are generated using the make-squares-8bit.c program in 
the ./util directory.

The macro.h and vcs.h file have been moved from the dasm machines folder into the folder containing the code we are compiling.

Use the compile.sh file to execute4 dasm and compile the rom file. You can then run this rom file using an emulator such as stella.
